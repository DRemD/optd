##
# That AWK script creates and adds a primary key for the Geonames dump file.
# The primary key is made of the IATA code and location type. For instance:
#  * ARN-A means the Arlanda airport in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * ARN-R means the Arlanda railway station in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * CDG-A means the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France
#  * PAR-C means the city of Paris, France
#  * NCE-CA means Nice, France, indifferentiating the airport from the city
#  * SFO-A means the San Francisco airport, California, US
#  * SFO-C means the city of San Francisco, California, US
#
# A few examples of IATA location types:
#  * 'C' for city
#  * 'A' for airport
#  * 'CA' for a combination of both
#  * 'H' for heliport
#  * 'R' for railway station
#  * 'B' for bus station,
#  * 'P' for (maritime) port,
#  * 'G' for ground station,
#  * 'O' for off-line point (usually a small city/village or a railway station)
#
# A few examples of Geonames feature codes
# (see http://www.geonames.org/export/codes.html):
#  * PPLx:  Populated place (city)
#  * ADMx:  Administrative division (which may be a city in some cases)
#  * AIRB:  Air base; AIRF: Air field; AIRP: Airport; AIRS: Seaplane landing
#           field
#  * AIRQ:  Abandoned air field
#  * AIRH:  Heliport
#  * FY:    Ferry port
#  * PRT:   Maritime port
#  * RSTN:  Railway station
#  * BUSTN: Bus station; BUSTP: Bus stop
