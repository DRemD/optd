##
# That AWK script creates and adds a primary key for the Amadeus RFD dump file.
# The primary key is made of the IATA code and location type. For instance:
#  * ARN-A means the Arlanda airport in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * ARN-R means the Arlanda railway station in Stockholm, Sweden
#  * CDG-A means the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France
#  * PAR-C means the city of Paris, France
#  * NCE-CA means Nice, France, indifferentiating the airport from the city
#  * SFO-A means the San Francisco airport, California, US
#  * SFO-C means the city of San Francisco, California, US
#
# A few examples of IATA location types:
#  * 'C' for city
#  * 'A' for airport
#  * 'CA' for a combination of both
#  * 'H' for heliport
#  * 'R' for railway station
#  * 'B' for bus station,
#  * 'P' for (maritime) port,
#  * 'G' for ground station,
#  * 'O' for off-line point (usually small airports or railway stations)
#
# That script relies on the ORI-maintained list of POR (points of reference),
# provided by the OpenTravelData project (http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd).
# Issue the 'prepare_rfd_dump_file.sh --geonames' command to see more detailed
