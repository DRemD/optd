------------------ Original README file from the Perl module ---------------------
This module a simple file-based database.  This database simply contains
IP blocks as keys, and countries as values.  The data contains all
public IP addresses and should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest mirror,
or to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your visiters.

To install, see the INSTALL file.

MaxMind offers a subscription to database updates, where your systems can
be keep up to date by running geoipupdate program included in the C API
